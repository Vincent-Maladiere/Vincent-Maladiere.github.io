Welcome to my blog, a never-ending work in progress. Make yourself confortable. 
I'm a R&D Data Scientist, eager to keep my learning curve as vertical as possible.
To do so, I like to shorten long courses and compete to Kaggle challenges.

Data science is a blurry buzz word, so let's clarify what I'm really passionnate about.
I'm thriving between two worlds: the analysis of a product, of a market, of users and the experimental development of this very product.
This means that I'm alternatively a data analyst and a software engineer.

Both fields have something in common: statistics and machine learning, where all the magic happens. Here is my sweet spot:

This blog is entirely focus on the magic part.
