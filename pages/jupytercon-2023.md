## JupyterCon 2023 - Predictive Survival Analysis and Competing Risk Modeling

![jupytercon_sk](/imgs/jupytercon_sk.png)

See [the poster of the talk](https://cfp.jupytercon.com/2023/talk/ACPULZ/)

This tutorial is split into 2 notebooks:

- Part 1: we introduce the main metrics and estimators used in survival analysis, along with our new Gradient Boosted CIF model for competing events.
    
- Part 2: we detail the concept of sessionization: by transforming raw logs of activity, we can create labels for survival analysis in an implicit or heartbeat fashion. We showcase this feature engineering with both DuckDB and Polars.
