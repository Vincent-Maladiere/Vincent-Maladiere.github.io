# OpenCV Advanced Tutorials
    
OpenCV is a rich and complete environment for image manipulation and preprocessing and has become the backbone for many computer vision projects. It can also act like a naive baseline to benchmark against more advanced models for deep learning purposes.

While its core is in C++, its Java and Python implementations offer both benefits and drawbacks. The main benefits are easy embedding into robotics and hardware projects and high compatibility with the ROS environment.

However, as the number of modules has kept increasing, the documentation is often inconsistent and the implementation is non-pythonic. It all makes OpenCV for python harder to learn.

This page is an aggregation from different OpenCV tutorials, almost like a cheatsheet, for you to understand the main concepts faster. I found it pretty helpful while developing computer vision applications, and I hope it will be handy for you as well.
