- Requirements
    - Easily maintainable
    - Same feature implementation during training and inference
    - Use past data in real-time models
    - Implement a feature once

- Beamter drawbacks
    - Cool but no real-time data caching
    - Sync versions between project
- Use Snowflake streams and tasks, define features as SQL function
    - No kafka, no spark, no new things to learn

    - Fivetran delays here are a bottleneck, will be replaced with some events using Kafka

- In summary, you can build features store with 3 components: Snowflake, Lambdas and Redis
