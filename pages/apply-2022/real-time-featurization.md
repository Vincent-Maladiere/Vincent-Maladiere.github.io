- This talk is specifically about feature maintenance and how to keep features refreshed
- How often to update data transformation? Infrequent batch vs streaming system in real-time?
    
    Unclear where to land for different apps
    
    - A lot of features are not that important, might never be queried, power-law distribution on feature query. A waste of resources to keep them up-to-date

- Consider first the cost of feature maintenance and then how much quality (tradeoff)
    
    Improve the tradeoff by being smart about priorization

- What is data quality?
    
    Ratio of actual feature performance over the optimal/ideal features
    
    Define feature-store regret = prediction error with actual feature - ideal feature
    

- If able to measure the accuracy of models, able to approximate the regret:
    
    Can determine which feature leads to less regret
    
    Less important to update vs more important by tracking the cumulative regret overtime

- For every feature-pair we track regret and take the key with the highest regret and update

- Higher accuracy for the same cost using this regret scheduling, different feature updates by timesteps, improving our tradeoff
    
    Freshness ‚â† accuracy, they are correlated but not equal so it is another reason to look at model error for feature quality
    

- ‚Äúralf‚Äù is a declarative dataframe API for defining features, with fine-grained control over managing feature updates, built for ML operation (python/ray)
    - treat features as static dataframe
    - increment in real-time with upcoming event
    - easy integration with existing ML system
