> In this book, we will cover the most common types of ML, but from a probabilistic perspective. Roughly speaking, this means that we treat all unknown quantities (tomorrowâ€™s temperature, or the parameters of some model) as random variables, that are endowed with probability distributions that describe a weighted set of possible values the variable may have. 
There are two main reasons we adopt a probabilistic approach. First, it is the optimal approach to decision-making under uncertainty. Second, probabilistic modeling is the language used by most other areas of science and engineering and thus provides a unifying framework between these fields.
