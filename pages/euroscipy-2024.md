## EuroScipy 2024 - Skrub: Bringing everything into the model

![](/euroscipy-szc.png)

Jérome Dockès and I presented the latest development and vision of
[skrub](https://skrub-data.org/stable/) at [EuroScipy 2024 Szczecin](https://euroscipy.org/2024/index.html).

When it comes to designing machine learning predictive models, it is reported that data scientists spend over 80% of their time      **preparing data** for machine learning algorithms.

Currently, no automated solution exists to address this problem. The skrub Python library is here to **alleviate some of the daily tasks of data scientists** and offer an integration with the scikit-learn machine learning library.

Our main message is that all the preprocessing and tedious dataframe code **should be in the model**, because:
1. It allows you fine tune hyper-parameters of your preprocessors
2. It significantly ease deploying and versioning ML models
