**Current endeavors:**

At Inria Saclay, I'm part of the [Soda team](https://team.inria.fr/soda/), contributing to open-source libraries like [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [skrub](https://skrub-data.org/stable/), and [hazardous](https://github.com/soda-inria/hazardous/). On scikit-learn, I focused on optimizing pairwise distance for sparse matrices, which resulted in a 20x speedup for algorithms like kNN and tSNE.

I'm also a maintainer of skrub, a data wrangling project led by Ga√´l Varoquaux. Skrub mission is to enhance data preprocessing with machine learning, ‚Äúless data wrangling, more machine learning.‚Äù

**Research & Contributions:**

Together with Olivier Grisel, we created hazardous, aiming to make survival analysis and competing risks more accessible to the Python community. We then wrote the paper "Teaching Models To Survive: Proper Scoring Rule and Stochastic Optimization with Competing Risks" with Julie Albert.

**Speaking Engagements:**

I've been lucky enough to present our work at JupyterCon 2023, EuroScipy 2022 & 2023, and the Axa Dev Summit 2023, sharing insights on survival analysis and introducing skrub to a diverse audience.

**Educational Pursuits:**

I taught Python for Data Science at Polytechnique and survival analysis at Dauphine University, where I used Kaggle and Jupyterlite to ensure an interactive learning experience.

**Past Experiences:**

Before joining Inria, I was a ML engineer at Spendesk, a leading European startup. My projects ranged from transactions and revenue forecasting to real-time detection of duplicated transactions and churn probability estimation. I also co-founded Chasseur Particulier, a prominent flat-hunter agency in Paris, where I developed the backend scraper.

**Academic Credentials:**

I hold an MSc in Engineering from [Grenoble Alpes University](http://www.shanghairanking.com/institution/universit-grenoble-alpes), INP Phelma, specializing in Signal Processing, Computer Science, and Machine Learning.
