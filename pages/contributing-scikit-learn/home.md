# Contributing to Scikit-Learn

Created: August 7, 2022 3:00 PM

Contributing for the first time to a rich package like scikit-learn can seem like an exciting but daunting task. In addition to a large codebase, you must get acquainted with the developer experience and review process to make a contribution.

Finding a good first issue in itself is challenging! With many people all around the world wanting to be a part of it, finding a well defined issue to fix or a feature to develop is often not obvious.

This tutorial is a collection of notes written while contributing to scikit-learn for the first time myself. These notes are a simple revamp of some existing documentation, plus some helpful material.

I hope this minimalistic guide will help you in your journey :)
