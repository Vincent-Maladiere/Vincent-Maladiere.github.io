## EuroScipy 2022 - Linear Algebra and Optimization Demo

I made a tutorial about scipy `linalg` and `optimization` modules, which was first introduced during EuroScipy 2022 at Basel.

[vincent-maladiere.github.io/scipy-demo](https://vincent-maladiere.github.io/scipy-demo)

It is a beginner-friendly tutorial, addressed to python programmers interested in getting to know more about some of the core operations in machine learning: matrix operations and optimizers.

The tutorial is made interactive thanks to Jupyter Lite, no local setup is required. Because scripts run directly in the browser through WebAssembly and Piodyde, python packages are downloaded during the launch of the kernel and that might cause some latencies.
